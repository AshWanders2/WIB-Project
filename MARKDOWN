**WIB (Windows Integrity Baseline)** is a simple, open tool that gives you a **day-one receipt of your Windows system**.  

It captures certificates, drivers, services, autoruns, and boot security details so you can prove what your system looked like before compromise.  
Think of it as a **birth certificate for your computer**:

- Run once when your system is fresh.  
- Save the baseline securely.  
- Compare later to spot tampering or malware persistence.

## Features
- Capture root & intermediate certificates with SHA-256 hashes  
- Inventory drivers, services, autoruns, and scheduled tasks  
- Hash key registry hives for integrity checks  
- Record TPM, Secure Boot, and BitLocker status  
- Export baseline as JSON + ZIP archive  
- Optional encrypted archive + cloud upload  
- Planned: “diff mode” for instant today-vs-baseline comparison
